[1:00],Roy B. Adams,These are a few memories of my life. I'm gonna tell you some of the games I used to play as I grew up in Memphis. ,
[1:10],Roy B. Adams,"Used to go to Riverside Golf Course. Jim Burks and I would walk about six miles carrying four golf clubs, and we would get there before they opened the course so we could play for free. And then we'd go down, on the second hole we'd hunt for gold balls and take them and clean them up and sell them back to the people, the other golfers that came later on.",games;golf
[1:36],Roy B. Adams,"Another game we used to play was ""Kick the Can"" and also marbles. We played ""Paddy Grows"" [?], ""Ring"", ""Tag-along"", and just different marble games.",games
[1:55],Roy B. Adams,"We also used to shag golf balls at the park. We'd take a golf club, and I'd get out in the field, and Jim would drive a golf ball, and I would try to shag it down with a glove, which helped us in our ball games and all.",games;golf
[2:10],Roy B. Adams,"One time we were playing ball with the Junior American Legion team, and I was catching and Jim was pitching. So we thought we'd act like real ball players, the professionals. So I had a little plug of chewing tobacco in my mouth, chewing on it and spitting out like the catchers did, acting like a pro. Jim threw a ball and the batter fouled it off, hit me right in the center of my stomach, and I swallowed it, and I fell flat on my back and the world was just turning round and round. And I was sick as a pope [?] and I never did that again.",games;baseball
[2:49],Roy B. Adams,"We used to play sandlot games on Saturdays, and it would be a choose-up of sides, all the different kids from the neighborhood would come, and we'd go to this vacant field behind our house on Ridgeway. And we would chose a leader of each team, opposing team, and in order to choose the players, we would take a bat and one of us would throw it to the other and he would catch it. And I would say ""whole hand or none or crow's pick"". And what he would have to do is take it right where he had it and throw it over his shoulder or, if I said crow's pick, he would have to pick it up by the handle and throw it over his shoulder. And if he did it correctly, he would get first choice or second choice. ",games;baseball
[3:38],Roy B. Adams,"And we would play with balls that were taped up, sewed up. Batts that had nails in them. But we had a good time and really enjoyed it. Ball, baseball or softball, were two of the games I really enjoyed playing.",games;baseball
[3:51],Roy B. Adams,"One time we were playing in the field and it started raining. We ran under a big tree to keep from getting wet. And lightening struck the tree. And one of the boys, his name was Joe Straiter [sp?], was hit by the lightning, and it knocked him flat and he was unconcsious for a while. He recovered but he still suffered later on in life from the shoulder wound.",games;baseball;health
[4:19],Roy B. Adams,"Another time we were stealing apples from a rancher named Squire Clancy. One of us was up in the tree, I can't remember who, but the squire came over the hilltop and fired a shotgun filled with dried butter beans and rock salt at us. And I can't recall who got hit, but we picked rock salt out of his backside for a long, long time. We never did that again.",mischief;health
[4:47],Roy B. Adams,"The other thing that we used to do is, on Squire Clancy's property, he had watermelons. In the evenings or late nights, we'd go out and get a watermelon, take it up on the hilltop, and break it open on a stump which was up there. And then we'd just eat the center, or the ""choice loin"" so to speak, of the watermelon.",mischief
[5:07],Roy B. Adams,"One time, Squire Clancy was waiting on us with the same shotgun loaded with the same rock salt and dried butter beans, and he fired at us and we scampered down the hill. We never did that again.",mischief
[5:22],Roy B. Adams,"Another thing we used to do, is we'd go to the railroad tracks. When the train stopped to take on water, we'd jump on the coal car, which was normally in the back, and throw off the coal, and when the train pulled off, we'd pick it up, take it home, and burn it. That's how we heated our houses at times.",mischief
[5:42],R. Brian Adams,"Ok, so how far did you have to travel to get to school, and how did you get there?",school
[5:47],Roy B. Adams,"Well, I walked, and the elementary school was about five miles, round trip. The highschool I attended was about three and a half miles. In the wintertime, my mother used to give me a baked potato, and I would hold it in my hands to keep them warm, and when I got to school, I had to eat the potato at recess or lunch time and all.",school
[6:15],R. Brian Adams,"So, did you go to ball games as a boy?",baseball
[6:17],Roy B. Adams,"Yes, I did. When I was in elementary school, I belonged to what they call the ""Chickasaw Buddies"" and what that was, we had a little beanie cap that had ""Chickasaw Buddies"" on it. Every Wednesday when the Memphis Chicks, which was a Triple-A team, would play at Rushwood Park, the school would let us out early and we'd walk about three or four blocks to the park and watch the ball game. We paid 50 cents for the little cap, and we had a little card that said ""Chickasaw Buddy, Rooter for the Memphis Chicks"".",baseball;hats
[6:55],Roy B. Adams,"Another time my dad took me to play, I'm sorry, took me to see a professional ball game. The Birmingham Barons were playng the Kansas City Monarchs. Satchel Paige was pitching for the Kansas City Monarchs and he struck out just about every batter. He never did tell his age, but when they finally allowed him in to play professional ball, they used to set him out in the dugout, or outside the dugout in a rocking chair. He threw the ball so hard that it looked like a golf ball coming up. He was a great pitcher and a credit to the ball game.",baseball
[7:38],R. Brian Adams,Tell me about your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren.,grandchildren;great-grandchildren
[7:41],Roy B. Adams,"There were seven grandchildren, and I'll name them for you: Heidi, Robert, Alexa, Emily, Layla, Sarah, and Spencer. The great-grandchildren were Mallory, Zach, Haily, Rachel, Jacob, and Reeve. But as far as I'm concerned, they were all great kids, and a credit to our family.",grandchildren;great-grandchildren
[8:15],R. Brian Adams,What are some words of wisdom you might give to your grandchildren?,grandchildren;great-grandchildren;advice
[8:19],Roy B. Adams,"Several. One would be look before you leap. Never count your chickens before they are hatched. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you throw dirt, you loose ground, and never give up. Remember in the bible it says that Moses was a basket case. [laughter]",grandchildren;great-grandchildren;advice
[8:45],Roy B. Adams,"I'm going to check at this time to see how observant you are, if you noticed that I have changed hats. The first hat I had on was my Navy cap, hat, as a World War II veteran, a radio operator. The next one I have on is the ""Old Dude"" hat, which is made up of achy breaky parts. I'll be 90 July the 3rd this year, and I'm not falling apart yet. [laughter]",hats
[9:18],R. Brian Adams,"Okay, tell us about one of the family's Christmas traditions.",Christmas
[9:23],Roy B. Adams,"The main one I can remember, and we still practice it today, and so does our family apart from me. We used to open our Christmas presents, one at a time, and it would usually take about three and a half hours. We would begin with the oldest and they would open the present saying who it was from. And the youngest one would pass out all the presents. Grannie always insisted that we tell who it was from, and we had bags that we put the wrappings in so that we wouldn't have to have a messy floor when we ended up. We always had a good time, and it was an enjoyable part of our Christmas day.",Christmas
